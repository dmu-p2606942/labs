      <h1 style="color:white;"> Ronnie O'sullivan </h1>

      <div>

      </div>

      <div>
        <p> Ronnie Osullivan is the Goat of snooker, he has established this for many years.
          He recently levelled Stephen Hendry's 7 World titles by beating Judd Trump 17-13.
          He is an Inspiration to me as not only do i want to play like him he also speaks wise
          words, which impact me. Throughout the world championships 2022 Ronnie looked Favourite
          to win it as he was dominating every player. Trump said that it was just an honour for him
          even to get a game out of Ronnie, this shows the respect that the players have for Ronnie.

      <h1 style="color:white;"> Jose Mourinho </h1>

      <div>
      <img src="img/mourinho.jpg" alt="Jose Mourinho" />
      </div>

      <div>
        <p> Jose Mourinho is one of the best managers in Football history. His passion is shown
          through his interviews and celebrations on the pitch. He has won many titles with
          chelsea and i really started to watch him when he took in charge of Tottenham Hotspurs.
          He also has good impacts on young players.

      <h1 style="color:white;"> Heung Min Son </h1>

      <div>
      <img src="img/son.jpg" alt="Heung Min Son" />
      </div>

      <div>
        <p> Heung Min Son is probably the best left winger in the premier league. He is my inspration
          because the style in which he plays makes me remember of the way i play on the pitch. Not only
          is he a serious player but he is also a very good person off the pitch and this is shown in videos
          as he makes his teammates kids smile and plays around with them very child like.
       </p>
      </div>

      <h1 style="color:white;"> Lucas Moura </h1>

      <div>
      <img src="img/moura.jpg" alt="Lucas Moura" />
      </div>

      <div>
        <p> Lucas Moura is another great player and he is my inspiration as he teaches me to never give up
          as every Spurs fan will remember Lucas Moura for that last minute iconic goal against Ajax who looked
          like they were going to win it but no Lucas never gave up and continued his run and eventually scored
          past Onana to give Spurs the victory.
