          <p> My favourite things to eat i would say are macaronie cheese as i order that everytime i do go to a restaurant. Furthermore, another Favourite
            of mine is a battered sausage with cheesy chips as whenever i am feeling unhealthy i will get that. I also love a good margherita pizza that melts
            in the mouth. For breakfast i realy like to have an english breakfast as i like to start the day off with a good strong meal. I also like my fruits
            such as grapes, banannas, apples and especially avocadoes. Furthermore, i also like a chicken parmesan. The best chicken parmesan was from a shop in
            Birmingham called chickaros.
