      <div>
        <h3 style="color:white;"> Geography </h3>
      </div>
     <p> I studied Geography for GCSE as i had the choice between geography and History but i was always going to choose geogrpahy.
       I already had a good knowledge about countries and cities, but i realised geography is not only about countries there are more to it.
       i got a grade 7 for geography.
     </p>

     <div>
       <h3 style="color:white;"> Statistics </h3>
     </div>
    <p> Stats was an option everyone dreaded, as Statistics was for the Clever kids as they would say, but i chose it as i was really good at maths
      and i was probably one of the brightest students in the class. I got a grade C for stats.
    </p>

    <div>
      <h3 style="color:white;"> Sports Studies </h3>
    </div>
   <p> Sports studies was my favourite as i was physically really good at sports but when it came to the theory work i disliked it as a lot of it was about
     the human body and anything anatomy related i wasn't good at. I got a grade Merit for sports studies.
   </p>

   <div>
     <h3 style="color:white;"> Other Studies </h3>
   </div>
  <p> I also studied science which i dreaded as i wasn't really god at it. I also did Maths which i was really good at. I also did Spanish
    which was really interesting as i learnt new words every lesson and had formed it into sentences to paragraphs. I was able to speak Spanish with
    my spanish friends. I also went to Villareal for a holiday and spoke to tourists and spaniards from villareal in spanish to.

     <div>
       <h3 style="color:white;"> A LEVEL MEDIA </h3>
     </div>
    <p> A level Media was very interesting as it was all about films and movies which i love. Furthermore, i knew i was going to study Media In university so why
      not choose Media as an A level. I also had a very good teacher named Mr Watts as he was really good at explaining new words and theories of different speakers.
      Furthermore, i got a grade B in a level media, as i give credit to my teacher for being very understanding and being a great teacher.
    </p>

    <div>
      <h3 style="color:white;"> A LEVEL ENGLISH </h3>
    </div>
   <p> A level English was really hard as the jump from GCSE English to A level was a significant difference as i studied the books Kite Runner and Woman in black.
     I was good at writing poems and creative writing in general. As i did English Lit and lang this was a suprise for my friends as you normally only do either Literature
     or language but i wanted a challenge so i did both.
   </p>

   <div>
     <h3 style="color:white;"> BTEC LEVEL 3 SPORTS </h3>
   </div>
  <p> I did anatomy and physiology, which was really difficult and i thought that most of it will be physical sports but i had no idea that nearly 60% of the Course
    was theory based. I did better in the anatomy side than the physiology side as anatomy was just about the human body and bones. Whereas the physiology side is
    about fitness and other aspects of the human body.

  </div>
  <div>
    <h3 style="color:white;"> MULTIMEDIA </h3>
  </div>
 <p> Multimedia is really interesting as making your own websites is all cool and fun untill you miss out a few symbols in the code. Furthermore, Thom Corah
   was the teacher for Year 1 multimedia. He was a really good teacher as he taught very well. Second year teacher was Mr Perez who was a fantastic teacher
   as he would always help when asked questions and make you understand.
 </p>

 <div>
   <h3 style="color:white;"> VIDEO AND IMAGING </h3>
 </div>
<p> Video imaging was interesting as making films and taking pictures was really interesting. I was not good with the camera before i took this course now i am
  really good at taking shots and shots in different angles.
</p>

<div>
  <h3 style="color:white;"> RADIO BROADCASTING </h3>
</div>
<p>  Radio was my favourite module as i had Simon Walsh as my tutor who was a really good teacher. Furthermore, we also had to do weekly Ofcom online tests as it was
  all about what you can and can't do in a radio show. I also took part in a radio show as i was the speaker and we invited guests to speak to. We did 3 live shows
  and in all the live shows i enjoyed it thoroughly.
</p>

<div>
  <h3 style="color:white;"> TV BROADCASTING </h3>
</div>
<p> Television BROADCASTING was very interesting as we had to create 2 Live shows one being 10 minutes long and the other being 20 minutes long. The teachers that i had
  was Simon and Paul as they were very good at explaining what we can and can't do inside the studio. Furthermore, i was the floor manager when it came to the shows going live.
