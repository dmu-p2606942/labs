      <h1 style="color:white;"> CRICKET </h1>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p> I currently play for a cricket club called Bitteswel Cricket Club. Bitteswell cricket club are in division 2 which is a very good division
        Considering the fact that there are 10 divisions. The role in my cricket club is that i wicket keep. Wicket keeping is the hardest role in CRICKET
        as not only do you have to catch the balls that the batsmen miss or leave but you also have to keep a good awareness and concentration level throughout
        every minute of the match. My highest runs i have done for the club is 42 runs, which i was close to my half century.

      <h1 style="color:white;"> FOOTBALL </h1>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p> Football arguably is the best sport in the world as it is played at a very high intensity which means you need to have good stamina and good cardiovascular
        endurance. I also play for a football Club called Kingz United FC who are in a very high division aswell. I play center attacking midfield as i am a very technical
        and creative player. Ilike to link up player and also have a very good vision when it comes to passing. In football i support Tottenham Hotspurs,  my favourite player
        is Harry Kane as he is the best striker in the world. Not only is he a lethal finisher he also a good passer of the ball.

    <div>
      <h1 style="color:white;"> POOL </h1>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p> Pool is what i love to play in my free time. I have won so many tournaments and i do believe i am a really good player. I rarely miss a pot and my ball control is
        really good. I also watch a lot of snooker and as pool is close to snooker it makes me more passionate about the sport. I also am a very competitive player as i go
        with my friends to play and i win most the time. My favourite pool player i would say is Joshua filler as he plays similarly to me and is very good at long pots.
        Below is a video of me playing pool.
