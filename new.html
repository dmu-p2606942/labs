    <h1>ALL ABOUT REZA</h1>
    <p>My name is Reza i am 19 years of age and i study at de montfort university. My hobbies consists of playing football, cricket and going to the gym. i love to stay fit and healthy and to maintain this
      i go for a jog every morning at 7am. I play for a cricket club and a football club which really shows the passion i have
      for the sports. Now, going on to my favourite thing to do in my free time is to play pool as i have had a passion for pool
      since a very young age and i have also entered pool tournaments and came out victorious. I would say my inspiration growing up was
      my mother as she taught and showed me that "in life nothing is impossible as even impossible has the word possible in". My favourite nothing
      to eat would probably be a sausage roll just because i love the outer crust and the sausage itself.
